    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Cheesecake is a decadent dessert made with a rich, creamy filling
      consisting of cream cheese, sugar, and eggs, all baked on top of a buttery
      graham cracker crust. It can be served plain or topped with various
      fruits, sauces, or chocolate.

        <h3>Step 1: Prepare the crust</h3>
        <p>
          Mix together graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, and sugar. Press
          the mixture into the bottom of a springform pan to form the crust.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 2: Prepare the filling</h3>
        <p>
          In a mixing bowl, beat cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla extract until
          smooth. Add eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Pour
          the filling over the crust.

        <h3>Step 3: Bake</h3>
        <p>
          Bake the cheesecake in a preheated oven at 325°F (160°C) for about
          55-60 minutes, or until the edges are set and the center is slightly
          jiggly.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 4: Chill</h3>
        <p>
          Allow the cheesecake to cool completely at room temperature, then
          refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight to set.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 5: Serve</h3>
        <p>
          Remove the cheesecake from the springform pan and slice. Serve
          chilled, optionally topped with whipped cream, fruit compote, or
          chocolate sauce.
