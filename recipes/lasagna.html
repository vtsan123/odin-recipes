    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Lasagna is a classic Italian dish consisting of layers of wide pasta
      sheets, meat sauce, cheese, and often other ingredients such as vegetables
      or herbs. The layers are typically baked until the pasta is cooked and the
      cheese is melted and bubbly, resulting in a rich and hearty casserole-like
      dish.

        <h3>Step 1: Prepare the ingredients</h3>
        <p>
          Gather lasagna noodles, meat sauce (usually made with ground beef or
          sausage and tomato sauce), cheese mixture (typically ricotta,
          mozzarella, and Parmesan), and any additional desired ingredients like
          vegetables or herbs.

        <h3>Step 2: Layer the ingredients</h3>
        <p>
          In a baking dish, start by spreading a layer of meat sauce on the
          bottom. Then, add a layer of lasagna noodles, followed by a layer of
          cheese mixture and any additional ingredients. Repeat these layers
          until the dish is full, finishing with a layer of meat sauce on top.

        <h3>Step 3: Bake</h3>
        <p>
          Cover the lasagna with aluminum foil and bake in a preheated oven
          according to the recipe instructions, typically around 375°F (190°C)
          for about 45-60 minutes, or until the noodles are cooked through and
          the cheese is melted and bubbly.
        </p>

      <li>
        <h3>Step 4: Serve</h3>
        <p>
          Allow the lasagna to cool for a few minutes before slicing and
          serving. Garnish with fresh herbs or grated Parmesan cheese if
          desired, and enjoy!
