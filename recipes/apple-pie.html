    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Apple pie is a classic dessert made with a flaky pastry crust and a
      filling of sliced apples, sugar, and spices. It is often served warm with
      a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <h3>Step 1: Prepare the crust</h3>
        <p>
          Prepare a pie crust using flour, butter, salt, and cold water. Roll
          out the dough and line a pie dish with it.
        </p>
      </li>

        <h3>Step 2: Prepare the filling</h3>
        <p>
          Peel and slice apples and toss them with sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and
          a squeeze of lemon juice. Place the filling into the prepared pie
          crust.
        </p>
      </li>

        <h3>Step 3: Assemble the pie</h3>
        <p>
          Roll out another piece of pie dough for the top crust. Place it over
          the filling and crimp the edges to seal. Cut slits in the top crust to
          allow steam to escape during baking.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 4: Bake</h3>
        <p>
          Bake the pie in a preheated oven at 375°F (190°C) for about 45-55
          minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 5: Serve</h3>
        <p>
          Allow the pie to cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.
          Enjoy warm with your favorite accompaniment!
